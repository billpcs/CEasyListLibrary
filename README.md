CEasyListLibrary
===================

A Library for easy List Handling.

Only **ints** are supported. This means that you can not have list of list , list of floats etc.

Methods that will be implemented(in bold those that are already implemented):

 + **append()**
 
 + extend()
 
 + **insert()**
 
 + remove()
 
 + **pop()**
 
 + index()
 
 + count()
 
 + sort()
 
 + reverse()

I have also implementd:
**printlist()** , **filllist()** , ***setlist()*** , ***length()*** and ***getitem()***. 

Please see wiki for examples.
