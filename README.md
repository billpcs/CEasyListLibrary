CEasyListLibrary
===================

A Library for easy List Handling. As easy as Python!

Python List Methods(in bold those that I have implemented):

 + **append(x)**
 
 + extend(L)
 
 + **insert(i, x)**
 
 + remove(x)
 
 + pop(i)
 
 + index(x)
 
 + count(x)
 
 + sort(cmp=None, key=None, reverse=False)
 
 + reverse()

I have also implementd **printlist()** , **filllist()** and ***setlist()*** that do not exist in Python. 

Please see wiki for examples.
